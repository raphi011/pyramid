# Framework Gotchas & Patterns

Lessons learned from implementation — framework-specific pitfalls and the patterns we use to work around them. **Read when debugging unexpected behavior or before using an unfamiliar API.**

---

## Next.js

### `searchParams` is a Promise (Next.js 15+)

In server components, `searchParams` must be `await`ed. This was a breaking change in Next.js 15.

```tsx
// page.tsx (server component)
type Props = { searchParams: Promise<{ code?: string }> };

export default async function Page({ searchParams }: Props) {
  const { code } = await searchParams; // Must await!
  return <ClientComponent code={code} />;
}
```

### Middleware `PUBLIC_ROUTES` uses prefix matching

Routes in `PUBLIC_ROUTES` are matched with `pathname.startsWith(route)`. Adding `"/join"` matches both `/join` and `/join?code=X`. Be aware this also matches `/join-something` — if that becomes an issue, switch to exact matching or regex.

### Server Actions with `useActionState` (React 19)

For multi-step forms, use `useActionState` with a state machine pattern. Each action returns the next step:

```tsx
const [state, action, isPending] = useActionState(serverAction, initialState);
```

The state object carries `step`, `error`, and any data needed by the next step. This replaces the older `useFormState` API.

### `redirect()` throws (not returns)

Next.js `redirect()` from `next/navigation` works by throwing a special error. It must be called **outside** of try/catch blocks, or the catch will swallow the redirect. In server actions, call it after all DB work completes.

### Middleware deprecation warning

Next.js 16 shows `"middleware" file convention is deprecated. Please use "proxy" instead.` — this is informational. The middleware still works. We'll migrate to the proxy convention in a future slice.

## JSON / i18n

### Typographic quotes break JSON parsing

German typographic quotes `„"` (U+201E opening, U+201C closing) look similar to ASCII `"` (U+0022) but are different characters. JSON parsers can confuse the closing `"` (U+201C) with a string terminator.

**Fix:** Use Unicode escapes in JSON files:

```json
{
  "confirmJoin": "Möchtest du \u201E{club}\u201C beitreten?"
}
```

This renders identically (`Möchtest du „{club}" beitreten?`) but doesn't confuse the parser.

## postgres.js

### Transactions with `sql.begin()`

Use `sql.begin()` for multi-statement transactions. The callback receives a transaction-scoped `tx` object:

```ts
await sql.begin(async (tx) => {
  await joinClub(tx, playerId, clubId);
  await autoEnrollInActiveSeasons(tx, playerId, clubId);
  await createNewPlayerEvent(tx, clubId, playerId, {});
});
```

All repository functions accept `Sql | TransactionSql` so they work both standalone and inside transactions.

### Advisory locks for concurrent modifications

For operations like modifying standings arrays where concurrent writes could cause lost updates, use `pg_advisory_xact_lock`:

```sql
SELECT pg_advisory_xact_lock($seasonId);
```

This serializes concurrent modifications per season within the transaction scope.

## Security Patterns

### Open redirect protection for `returnTo`

When accepting a `returnTo` parameter from query strings (e.g., after magic link verification), validate it to prevent open redirects:

```ts
function isValidReturnTo(returnTo: string): boolean {
  return (
    returnTo.startsWith("/") &&   // Must be relative
    !returnTo.startsWith("//") && // Block protocol-relative (//evil.com)
    !returnTo.includes(":")       // Block javascript: and data: schemes
  );
}
```

### Email enumeration protection

When handling actions that involve looking up users by email (login, join requests), always return the same response regardless of whether the email exists:

```ts
// Always return check-email, even if no player found
const player = await getPlayerByEmail(email);
if (player) {
  await sendMagicLinkEmail(email, player.name, token);
}
return { step: "check-email" }; // Same response either way
```

### Idempotent join with UPSERT

`joinClub` uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to handle double-submissions gracefully. The `RETURNING` clause tells us if the insert actually happened:

```sql
INSERT INTO club_members (player_id, club_id, role, created)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, NOW())
ON CONFLICT (player_id, club_id) DO NOTHING
RETURNING player_id
```

`rows.length === 0` means the player was already a member.
